		Do you remember the questions in our school exams where we evaluated an infix, postfix or prefix expression?
		The only thing we could wish for then is a computer program that would directly give us the answer on entering the expression as input. 
		Well, guess what?
		A common question in the coding rounds of interviews is to write a program for “Expression evaluation using Stack”. 
		In this article, we will learn how to solve that question.
                The file getting processed and the converted Infix notations are |post_exp| ( A + B ) * C / D - E |\post_exp| and |pre_exp| ( A + B / C * ( D + C ) - F ) |\pre_exp| and |post_exp| m * n + ( p - q ) + r |\pre_exp| .
		One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
		so show this expression in to Infix form |post_exp|ABC-/D*E+ |\post_exp| and |post_exp| mn*pq-+r+|\post_exp|. 
		
                  To begin with, let us see how infix expression evaluation using stack.  |sol_exp| 2 * ( 5 * ( 3 + 6 ) ) / 5 - 2 |\sol_exp|.

		So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.		
		Total galxies in picture are |src| \images\img1 |\src|.

		This is simply a test of your stack management abilities.|pick| So, I hope you pass this test as well,|tick| so keep going. |hick|
		So now |\hick|I'm sick of this stuff|\tick|. |\pick| That, I believe, is sufficient.
